## Neuspell

NeuSpell is an open-source toolkit for context sensitive spelling correction in English. This toolkit comprises of 10 spell checkers, with evaluations on naturally occurring mis-spellings from multiple (publicly available) sources. To make neural models for spell checking context dependent, (i) we train neural models using spelling errors in context, synthetically constructed by reverse engineering isolated mis-spellings; and (ii) use richer representations of the context.This toolkit enables NLP practitioners to use our proposed and existing spelling correction systems, both via a simple unified command line, as well as a web interface. Among many potential applications, we demonstrate the utility of our spell-checkers in combating adversarial misspellings.
